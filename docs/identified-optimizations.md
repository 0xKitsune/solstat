## âš¡Identified Gas Optimizations
Below are the currently identified optimizations that solstat identifies. If you would like to check out a list of patterns that are ready to be implemented and you would like to add them to the repo, you can check out the [Contribution.md](https://github.com/0xKitsune/solstat/blob/main/Contributing.md#potential-optimizations-vulnerability-and-qa-additions)!

| Optimization              | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| address_balance           | Use `selfbalance()` instead of `address(this).balance`. |
| address_zero              | Use assembly to check for `address(0)`. |
| assign_update_array_value | When updating a value in an array with arithmetic, using `array[index] += amount` is cheaper than `array[index] = array[index] + amount`. This optimization also catches other arithmetic, bitwise and other operations. |
| bool_equals_bool          | Instead of `if (x == bool)`, use `if(x)` or when applicable, use assembly with `iszero(iszero(x))`. |
| cache_array_length        | Cache array length during for loops. |
| constant_variable         | Mark storage variables as `constant` if they never change and are not marked as constants.|
| immutable_variable        | Mark storage variables as `immutable` if variables are assigned during deployment and never change afterwards.|
| increment_decrement       | Use `unchecked{++i}` instead of `i++`, or `++i` (or use assembly when applicable). This also applies to decrementing as well.|
| memory_to_calldata        | Use `calldata` for function arguments marked as `memory` that do not get mutated.|
| multiple_require          | Use multiple require() statements instead of require(expression && expression && ...). |
| optimal_comparison        | Use strict `>` & `<` operators over `>=` & `<=` operators. |
| pack_storage_variables    | Tightly pack storage variables for efficient contract storage. |
| pack_struct_variables     | Tightly pack struct variables for efficient contract storage. |
| payable_function          | Mark functions as payable (with discretion). |
| private_constant          | Mark constant variables in storage as private to save gas. |
| safe_math_post_080        | Identifies when SafeMath is being used if the contract using solidity >= 0.8.0. Using SafeMath when using version >= 0.8.0 is redundant and will incur additional gas costs. |
| safe_math_pre_080         | Identifies when SafeMath is being used if the contract using solidity < 0.8.0. Consider using assembly with overflow/undeflow protection for math (add, sub, mul, div) instead of SafeMath. |
| shift_math                | Right shift or Left shift instead of dividing or multiplying by powers of two. |
| solidity_keccak256        | Use assembly to hash instead of Solidity. |
| solidity_math             | Use assembly for math (add, sub, mul, div). |
| sstore                    | Use assembly to write storage values. |
| string_error              | Use custom errors instead of string error messages for contracts using Solidity version >= 0.8.4.|
| short_revert_string       | Use revert strings that fit in one word. |
