        format!("# Gas Optimizations - (Total Optimizations {})\n
The following sections detail the gas optimizations found throughout the codebase. 
Each optimization is documented with the setup, an explainer for the optimization, a gas report and line identifiers for each optimization across the codebase. For each section's gas report, the optimizer was turned on and set to 10000 runs. 
You can replicate any tests/gas reports by heading to [0xKitsune/gas-lab](https://github.com/0xKitsune/gas-lab) and cloning the repo. Then, simply copy/paste the contract examples from any section and run `forge test --gas-report`. 
You can also easily update the optimizer runs in the `foundry.toml`.\n\n<br>\n
